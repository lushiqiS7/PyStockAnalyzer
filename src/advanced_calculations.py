    """
    Calculate the maximum profit that could be achieved from buying and selling stocks.
    
    This function implements a greedy approach where it assumes you can buy and sell
    multiple times to maximize profit. It calculates profit by summing all positive
    price changes (buying at each local minimum and selling at each local maximum).
    
    Args:
        prices (list or array-like): A sequence of stock prices in chronological order.
        
    Returns:
        float: The maximum profit that could be achieved. Returns 0 if no profit
               is possible (prices only decline or stay flat).
               
    Example:
        >>> prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
        >>> calculate_max_profit(prices)
        7  # Buy at 1, sell at 5 (profit: 4), buy at 3, sell at 6 (profit: 3)
